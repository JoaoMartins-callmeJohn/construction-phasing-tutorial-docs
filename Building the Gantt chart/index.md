# Building the Gantt chart

As said in our landing page, this sample is based on our [tutorials](https://forge-tutorials.autodesk.io), so the first step (assuming you have a ready base sample) is creating the `BaseExtension.js` under `wwwroot/extensions`. From there, we'll add the two files `PhasingExtension` and `PhasingPanel`. With that, we'll be able to build a Gantt chart connected to the model based on the input csv, just like the gif below:

Below you have the steps in this section:

1. [Phasing Extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/building/phasingextension/)
1. [Phasing Panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/building/phasingpanel/)
1. [Configuration file]({{ site.baseurl }}/building/configuration/)

[Next step - Phasing Extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/building/phasingextension/){: .btn}
