# About the Tutorial

This tutorial focuses on building a Viewer extension focused on Construction Phasing. To achieve that, we'll go through the steps required, taking advantage of APS APIs and other libraries.
This tutorial should not be your first step on Autodesk Platform Services, if you're a first time user, please go through the Getting Started at [aps-tutorials](https://tutorials.autodesk.io).

You can also find the full source-code of this implementation on [github](https://github.com/JoaoMartins-callmejohn/construction-phasing-tutorial).

We also have a live demo [HERE](https://joaomartins-callmejohn.github.io/construction-phasing-tutorial/wwwroot/index.html)
